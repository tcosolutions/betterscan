   <p>1. Your relationship with TCO TOPCODERSONLINE (later referred as TCO) <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.1 Your use of TCO’s products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the “Services” in this document and excluding any services provided to you by TCO under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and TCO. “Scanmycode” means TCO, whose principal place of business is at Labedzia 38, Szczecin, Poland. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Scanmycode, your agreement with Scanmycode will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the “Universal Terms”.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.3 Your agreement with Scanmycode will also include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are referred to below as the “Additional Terms”. Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.4 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and Scanmycode in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the “Terms”.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.5 If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.<br /><br />2. Accepting the Terms<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1 In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.2 You can accept the Terms by:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by Scanmycode in the user interface for any Service; or<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B) by actually using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that Scanmycode will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.3 You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Scanmycode, or (b) you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.4 Before you continue, you should print off or save a local copy of the Universal Terms for your records.<br /><br />3. Language of the Terms<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.1 Where Scanmycode has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the Terms, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with Scanmycode.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.2 If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.<br /><br />4. Provision of the Services by Scanmycode<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.1 Scanmycode has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world (“Subsidiaries and Affiliates”). Sometimes, these companies will be providing the Services to you on behalf of Scanmycode itself. You acknowledge and agree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be entitled to provide the Services to you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.2 Scanmycode is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which Scanmycode provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.3 As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that Scanmycode may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally at Scanmycode’s sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform Scanmycode when you stop using the Services.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.4 You acknowledge and agree that if Scanmycode disables access to your account, you may be prevented from accessing the Services, your account details or any files or other content which is contained in your account.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.5 You acknowledge and agree that while Scanmycode may not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of storage space used for the provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may be set by Scanmycode at any time, at Scanmycode’s discretion.<br /><br />5. Use of the Services by you<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.1 In order to access certain Services, you may be required to provide information about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the Service, or as part of your continued use of the Services. You agree that any registration information you give to Scanmycode will always be accurate, correct and up to date.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.2 You agree to use the Services only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the Terms and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.3 You agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Scanmycode, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Scanmycode. You specifically agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Services through any automated means (including use of scripts or web crawlers) and shall ensure that you comply with the instructions set out in any robots.txt file present on the Services.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Services).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.5 Unless you have been specifically permitted to do so in a separate agreement with Scanmycode, you agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell the Services for any purpose.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Scanmycode has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the Terms and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Scanmycode may suffer) of any such breach.<br /><br />6. Your passwords and account security<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.1 You agree and understand that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of passwords associated with any account you use to access the Services.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.2 Accordingly, you agree that you will be solely responsible to Scanmycode for all activities that occur under your account.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.3 If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify Scanmycode immediately.<br /><br />7. Privacy and your personal information<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.1 For information about Scanmycode’s data protection practices, please read Scanmycode’s privacy policy. This policy explains how Scanmycode treats your personal information, and protects your privacy, when you use the Services.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.2 You agree to the use of your data in accordance with Scanmycode’s privacy policies.<br /><br />8.

You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this Content (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by Scanmycode or by the owners of that Content, in a separate agreement.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.3 Scanmycode reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to pre-screen, review, flag, filter, modify, refuse or remove any or all Content from any Service.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.4 You understand that by using the Services you may be exposed to Content that you may find offensive, indecent or objectionable and that, in this respect, you use the Services at your own risk.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Scanmycode has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any Content that you create, transmit or display while using the Services and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Scanmycode may suffer) by doing so.<br /><br />9. Proprietary rights<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.1 You acknowledge and agree that Scanmycode (or Scanmycode’s licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Services (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). You further acknowledge that the Services may contain information which is designated confidential by Scanmycode and that you shall not disclose such information without Scanmycode’s prior written consent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.2 Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Scanmycode, nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use any of Scanmycode’s trade names, trade marks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.3 If you have been given an explicit right to use any of these brand features in a separate written agreement with Scanmycode, then you agree that your use of such features shall be in compliance with that agreement, any applicable provisions of the Terms, and Scanmycode's brand feature use guidelines as updated from time to time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.4 Other than the limited license set forth in Section 11, Scanmycode acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content that you submit, post, transmit or display on, or through, the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Scanmycode, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that Scanmycode has no obligation to do so on your behalf.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.5 You agree that you shall not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trade mark notices) which may be affixed to or contained within the Services.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.6 Unless you have been expressly authorized to do so in writing by Scanmycode, you agree that in using the Services, you will not use any trade mark, service mark, trade name, logo of any company or organization in a way that is likely or intended to cause confusion about the owner or authorized user of such marks, names or logos.<br /><br />10.
